# Electricity Costs at a Data Center

## Project Brief 

You are working at a data center. One of the biggest costs for the center is the electricity required to run all of the servers. To ensure that they will continue to charge customers appropriately for their services, itâ€™s important for them to be able to estimate the price they will have to pay for running the center - in particular the electricity price. As well as knowing whether it is possible to get a reasonable estimate of the price, they would like to know if there are factors that cause the price to increase, so they can charge customers more for those situations.
